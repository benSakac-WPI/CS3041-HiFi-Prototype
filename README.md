# CS3041-HiFi-Prototype

Developed by Ben Sakac for CS3041 Human-Computer Interaction at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

The course project is a full-term individual project that allows students to design and implement a sophisticated, useful, and fun user interface. 

The prototype is hosted using Github Pages, and can be viewed [here](https://bensakac-wpi.github.io/CS3041-HiFi-Prototype/).

It was designed for mobile devices, and is best viewed on a phone. However, if you are using a desktop or laptop, you can utilize your browsers developer tools to simulate a mobile device. 

Instructions for accessing dev tools in Google Chrome:

- View -> Developer Tools -> Developer Tools (you can also do *ctrl+shift+i* or *Right-click on the page>inspect*
        -- (Note: If you don't see this: there may be "three dots" at the right corner of your screen, -> More tools -> Developer Tools)
- Use button to toggle device toolbar ![](https://github.com/cs3041-d22/lab0-v2/blob/main/img/image3.png) .
- You can test different types of devices. For example, to test iPhone, select iPhone SE from dropdown list:
