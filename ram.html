        <h2>RAM: </br> Random Access Memory</h2>

        <img src="assets/images/ram.png" class="centerImage">

        <p>RAM is a type of fast and temporary data storage where a computer stores information it may need rapid access to. RAM is an essential component for multitasking on a computer.</p>

        <p>You can think about it like this: </br>
            Imagine you are working with paper records. You are sitting at a desk, and next to the desk is a filing cabinet containing many records. You can think of the surface of the desk as the computerâ€™s RAM, and the filing cabinet as the computers hard drive. In order to accomplish a task, you might need to have several records on your desk. When you are done with that task, you can put all the related records back into the filing cabinet</p>
        
            <p>Moving this analogy back into the computer world, when you open an application on your computer all the data and information necessary for that app to run is stored in RAM. The more complex the app is, the more info is needed for it to run meaning more RAM usage.</p>

            <p>While there are other aspects of RAM, the most important is the amount of storage space the RAM has. The most common options are shown below:</p>

            <p>4GB - 8GB: Good for simple tasks like creating word documents or web browsing</p>
            <p>8GB - 16GB: Good for multitaskers or light to moderate gaming</p>
            <p>16GB - 32GB: Good for complex applications like video editing</p>
