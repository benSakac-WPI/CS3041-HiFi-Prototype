        <p>A laptop's hard drive is where all your files are stored, along with system and application files required to run the operating system (e.g. Windows or MacOS) and programs (like an internet browser). There are two main considerations you should make when deciding what kind of hard drive you want. </p>

        <p>The first consideration is the the storage capacity of the hard drive. Storage capacity is commonly measured using gigabytes (GB). You can also find hard drives with one terabyte (TB) or more of storage capacity, which is equal to 1000 GB. Increased storage capacity means you can have more sutff(files, pictures, videos, games, etc.) saved on your laptop. </p>

        <p>The second consideration is the type of hard drive. There are two types commonly found in laptops, hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs). SSDs are generally more performant (faster) than HDDs, and generally cost more as well. </p>
